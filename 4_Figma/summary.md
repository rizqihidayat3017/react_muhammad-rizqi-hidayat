## How to Set Up a Frame and a Simple Grid ?
Step 1 :
Create your new file and select the Frame tool (F) from the toolbar. Focus on the right sidebar and select the Desktop template to create your starting frame.

Step 2 :
Before you start the work on the design, let's set up a simple grid that will make it easier to align elements.

Focus on the Design panel in the right sidebar and click the Layout Grid section to add a grid to your design.

Click the blue icon to access the grid settings. Select Columns from the drop-down menu and then enter the settings shown in the following image.

## How to Create the Menu Bar of the Medical Website Design ?
Step 1 :
Select the Rectangle tool (R) from your toolbar and create a 1360 x 90 px shape. Focus on the right sidebar, set the Corner Radius to 10 and then click the Fill color wheel and change it to #4593FF.

Switch to the Move tool (V) and move your rounded rectangle as shown in the second image. Alternatively, you can enter 40 in the X box and 40 in the Y box to numerically move your shape in the desired location.

As you're about to use this blue color plenty of times throughout this tutorial let's save it as a color style so you can easily access or edit it later. Focus on the Fill section and click the quadruple dot icon to open the Color Styles flyout panel. Click the Create Style button (+), name this new color style Blue, and then click the Create style button.

Step 2 :
At times, you might want to disable the grid. You can easily do it from the right sidebar or using the Shift-Control-4 keyboard shortcut.

Pick the Text tool (T) from your toolbar, simply click inside your frame and focus on the Text section from the Design panel.

Select the Montserrat font, set the style to Medium and the size to 13. Change the text color to #F8FBFF, and then type in the "HOME" piece of text.

Save the color used for your text as a new color style and name it LightBlue.

Step 3 :
Hold down the Alt key and drag a copy of your text to the right, as shown in the following image. Also holding down the Shift key while dragging will constrain the movement of the copy to a single direction. Double click the new text to edit it and replace "HOME" with "ABOUT".

Repeat the same technique to add the "SERVICES", "DOCTORS" and "CONTACT" pieces of text. Make sure that you're always leaving a 70 px gap between each piece of text.

Step 4 :
Select your five pieces of text, right click on the selection and go to Add Auto Layout or use the Shift-A keyboard shortcut. This will add a frame around your selection and will give you multiple options to rapidly edit the content.

Have a look inside the right sidebar and notice that the Spacing Between Elements is set to 70. Editing this value will immediately adjust the spacing between your text elements. You can easily drag text elements to change their location within the stack or you can remove a text element and thanks to Auto Layout the remaining elements will automatically adjust their location.

Make sure that your text elements are still selected and center them on the blue rounded rectangle, as shown in the second image.

Step 5 :
Pick the Ellipse Tool (O), and hold down the Shift key to easily create a 13 px circle. Fill this new shape with LightBlue and place it as shown in the first image.

Switch to the Move Tool (V), hold down the Alt key and the Shift key, and drag a copy of your circle to the right as shown in the second image.

Select both circle and add copies on top of them (Control-C > Control-Shift-V). Select the copies and rotate them 90 degrees, as shown in the final image.

Step 6 :
Pick the Text tool (T) from your toolbar, add "HealthSpecialist" piece of text and set its color to LightBlue. Use the same Montserrat font that we'll use for the entire design, set the style to Bold and the size to 19. Select only the "Specialist" part from your text and change the style to Regular.

Select this piece of text along with the four circle and Group them (Control-G). Move to the left sidebar, in the Layers panel, double click your group and rename it "Logo". It's always a good idea to name and organize the elements of your design to easily access th em when you might need them again.

Step 7:
Focus on the right side of your blue shape. Pick the Text tool (T), add the "SIGN UP" piece of text and set its color to black, for now. Set the font style to Bold and the size to 15.

Use the Shift-A keyboard shortcut to Add Auto Layout for this new piece of text and move to the Design panel. First, focus on the Fill section to color the frame of this text. Use the + button to add a new fill and set its color to LightBlue. Move to the Auto Layout section and set both Horizontal & Vertical Padding to 10. Finally, set the Corner Radius to 5 and change the text color to Blue.

Step 8 :
Make sure that your button is still selected and click the Create Component button from the toolbar. Rename your new component "Button".

Pick the Text tool (T), add "LOG IN" piece of text and set its color to LightBlue. Set the font style to Bold and the size to 15. Place this new piece of text as shown in the second image.

## How to Create the Drop Down Menu of the Medical Website Design ?
Step 1 :
Pick the Text tool (T), add the "Phillis K Vance MD" piece of text and set its color to black, for now. Set the font style to Medium and the size to 10.

Add Auto Layout (Shift-A) for this text and focus on the Auto Layout section from the Design panel. Change the orientation to Vertical, set the Horizontal Padding to 10 and the Vertical Padding to 15. Add a new fill and set its color to Blue, set the Corner Radius to 5, and then change the text color to white (#FFFFFF). Save this color as a new style and name it White.

Finally, use one of those side handles to increase the width of this auto layout frame to 180 px.

Step 2 :
Switch to the Move Tool (V), hold down the Alt key and the Shift key, and drag a copy of your auto layout frame, as shown in the first image. Replace the existing name with the one shown in the image.

Repeat the same technique to add another two auto layout frames, as shown below.

Step 3 :
Select all four auto layout frames, right click on one of them and go to Frame Selection (Control-Alt-G) to put them all inside one frame.

Rename this new frame "DropDown.Doctors" and move it somewhere outside your main frame.
